              <h1>About Me</h1>
              <p>A little about me. My name is Jakub. I was born in Poland and moved to Chicago when I was around
              four years old. A couple years later, my family moved again to Romeoville. Fast forward to the
              present day, and I still live in Romeoville. I am currently attending Lewis University as a senior
              transfer student from Joliet Junior College. I will be graduating after this semester. I will be 
              completing my major in Computer Science with no specific concentration.</p>

              <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
              <p>I would have to say my favorite hobby is probably basketball. Between work and school, it 
              becomes difficult to find time to do something other than eat and sleep. However, when I do find I
              have some free time, I like to play basketball. I get together with some friends and maybe we go to
              the rec center, or maybe we go to a local park, or even play in someone's driveway. There is always
              food at some point when we play, so that makes it all the more enjoyable.</p>
