<h2 style="text-align: center">Introduction</h2>

<p style="text-align: center">
A little about me. My name is Jakub. I was born in Poland and moved to Chicago when I was around
four years old. A couple years later, my family moved again to Romeoville. Fast forward to the
present day, and I still live in Romeoville. I am currently attending Lewis University as a senior
transfer student from Joliet Junior College. I will be graduating after this semester. I will be 
completing my major in Computer Science with no specific concentration. 
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>

<ul class="a">
       <li>Working with a team on a single product/application</li>
       <li>Details about the software development cycle</li>
       <li>Best tools to utilize when developing software and how to use them</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center">My Favorite Hobby</h2>

<p style="text-align: center">
       I would have to say my favorite hobby is probably basketball. Between work and school, it 
becomes difficult to find time to do something other than eat and sleep. However, when I do find I
have some free time, I like to play basketball. I get together with some friends and maybe we go to
the rec center, or maybe we go to a local park, or even play in someone's driveway. There is always
food at some point when we play, so that makes it all the more enjoyable.
</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">Fun Fact</h2>

<p style="text-align: center">One fun fact about me is that I was born in Poland and I speak Polish.</p>
